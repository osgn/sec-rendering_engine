In a footnote to the fee table, state that the table and Example reflect the expenses of both the Feeder and Master Funds. If the prospectus offers more than one Class of a Multiple Class Fund or more than one Feeder Fund that invests in the same Master Fund, provide a separate response for each Class or Feeder Fund.  Base the percentages of "Annual Fund Operating Expenses" on amounts incurred during the Fund's most recent fiscal year, but include in expenses amounts that would have been incurred absent expense reimbursement or fee waiver arrangements. If the Fund has changed its fiscal year and, as a result, the most recent fiscal year is less than three months, use the fiscal year prior to the most recent fiscal year as the basis for determining "Annual Fund Operating Expenses."</link:label>

If there were expense reimbursement or fee waiver arrangements that reduced any Fund operating expenses and will continue to reduce them for no less than one year from the effective date of the Fund's registration statement, a Fund may add two captions to the table one caption showing the amount of the expense reimbursement or fee waiver, and a second caption showing the Fund's net expenses after subtracting the fee reimbursement or expense waiver from the total fund operating expenses. The Fund should place these additional captions directly below the "Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses" caption of the table and should use appropriate descriptive captions, such as "Fee Waiver [and/or Expense Reimbursement]" and "Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waiver [and/or Expense Reimbursement]," respectively. If the Fund provides this disclosure, also disclose the period for which the expense reimbursement or fee waiver arrangement is expected to continue, and briefly describe who can terminate the arrangement and under what circumstances.</link:label>
