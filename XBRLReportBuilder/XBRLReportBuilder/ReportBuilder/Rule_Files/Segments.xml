	<Description>
		This rule parses the data in a Report to determine if there is Segmented data that can be displayed in a vertical format.
		There are two conditions that could result in data being displayed this way.
			1.  The Report contains Consolidated and the reporting periods for that data covers all of the
				  reporting periods for each of the Segmented data sets.
			2.	The Report does not contain Consolidated data, but one of the Segmented data sets contains
					reporting periods that cover all of the reporting periods for the remaining Segmented data sets.
