  <Description>
    Normally when reporting beginning/ending balances, the preparer are using the same element for both.
    In the presentation hierarchy, the same element appear twice one with the preferred label role defines as "Beginning Balance" and the other defined as "Ending Balance"

    Without special processing, the beginning balance and ending balance for the same column (same reporting period) would have the same value.
    The processing logic would "shift" the ending balance value to beginning balance column based on the following logic:

    For the "Beginning Balance" rows in the report, the rendering engine goes through each cell and compares the "Period End Date" with other cells on the row.
    If the "Period End Date" is the same or one day before as the "Period Start Date" of another cell, "shift" (copy) the balance to this cell.
