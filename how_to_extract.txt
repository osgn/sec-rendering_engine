Start by extracting these files to a directory of your choice 
on the Windows machine where the process will run.

WINDOWS 2008 OR LATER

When using Windows Server 2008 or later, the extracted files will all 
be "blocked" and will need to be individually unblocked, which is tedious.

Alternatively, use a third party unzip utility to extract the files, 
and after unzipping, ensure that the local system user has "execute" 
privileges on all .dll and .exe files.
